# Machine-Learning
This repository contains various machine learning projects and Assignments I worked during my Post graduate Studies.
It starts with introduction to various libraries and their installation.
Basic exploration of few Machine Learning Libraries that are available in Python like Pandas, NumPy, SKLearn, Seaborn, Theano, SciPy, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow.
Exploration of certain subparts of the module sklearn - train_test_split, make_classification, make_regression, DummyClassifier and DummyRegressor
Evaluation metrics - accuracy_score, classification_report, and confusion_matrix
Understanding the various parameters of the above modules, by modifying them and observing the changes in the output.
Exploration of various EDA, Visualization techniques, Dimensionality reduction algorithms on various Datasets.
Performing predictive analysis. 
Comparison of Clustering methods and classification techniques.
